**LightROM** is a lightweight Fortran library for reduced-order modeling of large-scale *input-output linear time invariant dynamical systems*.
It is build on top of [**LightKrylov**](https://github.com/nekStab/LightKrylov), another package from our group providing implementations of various Krylov-based techniques in modern Fortran.

The project is ported by [Jean-Christophe Loiseau](https://loiseaujc.github.io/) and [Simon Kern](https://github.com/Simkern/).
It still is in its very early stages and more details about the project will be given later on.
